## About Iron Tanks

Iron Tanks is a Buildcraft add-on for Minecraft which adds tiered capacity and special purpose tanks to the game. Iron Tanks follows strict Minecraft physics, meaning a one block space can hold 8x more stuff as long as you build the container out of diamond, and as long as you surround the glass container with obsidian blocks, it will be explosion proof. These tanks and more can add hours of fun and excitement to the game:

 - Tiered capacity tanks, Glass (16 buckets), [Copper](https://github.com/Indemnity83/irontanks/wiki#copper-tank) (24 buckets), [Iron](https://github.com/Indemnity83/irontanks/wiki#iron-tank) (32 buckets), [Silver](https://github.com/Indemnity83/irontanks/wiki#silver-tank) (42 buckets), [Gold](https://github.com/Indemnity83/irontanks/wiki#gold-tank) (48 buckets) and [Diamond](https://github.com/Indemnity83/irontanks/wiki#diamond-tank) (64 buckets) each building on the proceeding tank to cram more and more stuff in the same cube of space!
 - In place [upgrade items](https://github.com/Indemnity83/irontanks/wiki#upgrades) so you don't have to worry about running out of space
 - Explosion proof [Obsidian](https://github.com/Indemnity83/irontanks/wiki#obsidian-tank) tanks
 - The black hole that is the Void tank (coming soon)
 - For your mock setups we present the Creative tank (coming soon)
